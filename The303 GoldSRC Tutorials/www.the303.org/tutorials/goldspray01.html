<h1>Tutorial 2: Spray with Hltagconverter With no Transparency</h1>
<p>Our first tutorial is creating a Simple spray.  <b class="red">Now with HLtagconverter you CAN just import any image you want and it will do all the resizing for you, however this tutorial is aimed at getting a better result by doing the resizing and enhancements in your image editor.</b>
<hr>
<p>1)Start off with the image you want to turn into a spraylogo, then check the <a href="goldsrcspraylogo.html#goldchart">chart</a> for a valid width.

<p><img src="goldsrclogoimages/static01.jpg" alt="THE MOST GENERIC SPRAY EVER">
<p>2)Choose a valid width size from the chart.  Resize the image with constrain proportions checked and "Bicubic Sharper". I am guessing 128 for the width.  When the width is resized in the window the height reads 78.  128X78= 9984; because this is under 12288, this is a valid surface size.

<p>3)When the image is resized do any enhancements you like such as levels, or contrast.  I am going with unsharpen mask.  Save the image as any lossless format.  I am saving the image as a 24bit TGA file.</p>
<p><img src="goldsrclogoimages/static03.jpg" alt="Sharpen">
<p>4)Open your image into HLtagconverter
<p><img src="goldsrclogoimages/static04.png" alt="HLtag">
<p>5)Click "Adjust image".  The program will automatically fix the dimensions of the height to 80 with a transparent area.  Click the apply changes.
<p><b>NOTE: The reason why I only made the width a valid size in photoshop and let HLtagconverter fix the height is because if a spray does not have a transparent colour set, it will screw up the spray.  When HLtagconverter fixes the height it fills the space in with transparent blue.  Also its not resizing the base image.</b>

<p>6)Save the image as a WAD file <a href="goldsrcspraylogo.html#directories">to your desired game directory</a>
<p><img src="goldsrclogoimages/logo05.png" alt="HLtag3">
<p>Right click to properties for your "tempdecal.wad" file and check "Read only".  This makes sure the decal is not overwritten when making changes in your multiplayer menu.
