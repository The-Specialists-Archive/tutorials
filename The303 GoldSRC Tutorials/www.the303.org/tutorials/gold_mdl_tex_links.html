<h1>Model Texture Methods Links</h1>
<hr>
<p>Ive been researching and wanting to put together a guide on many of the old methods of texturing that was common from the late 90s to early 2000s before special shaders and maps.  I will list links and resources as well as my commentary on various methods.  Ill begin with the old style:

<p>New(er) Methods:
<p>A newer method of painting is done in a hybrid method of painting on the texture as well as within the active 3d viewport, also known as "Viewport Canvas" or some other variarion:

<p>You can use modern highpoly to lowpoly workflow methods to bake out a "Complete Map" which is a render to texture of your model so all the light and bump/specular/gloss/normalmap is "baked in" to the diffuse.   To do this you set up all your materials, create an array of scene lights above your model then use "Render-To-Texture" to bake out the complete map or do it in separate passes for more control.
I have made a quick and dirty guide about doing fine tuning and control with baked maps:
<a href="../imaeg/bakedprocess2.png"> <img src="../imaeg/bakedprocess_thumb.jpg" />

<p></a>My "SkelePuncher" model was a highpoly-to lowpoly render bake using these methods

<hr>
<p>An important thing to note when making Cartoony ,Stylized or Anime models is that you may want to consider using either the reduced shadows flag (QC code $flags 256 ) or even use the Sven special texture mode $flatshade which discards shadows and lights the whole texture uniformly. This is best for Anime or painted shadows textures that would normally suffer under vertex shadows.   An example of lighting differences here:
