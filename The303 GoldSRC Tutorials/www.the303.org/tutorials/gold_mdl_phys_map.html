<h1>Compiling & Map setup for Baked Physics Model</h1>
<p>When you have your SMD's ready, create a QC compile script for your physics model.  What I have here for the brick scene (I have the scale slightly larger than default 1.0 due to my last minute changes).

$sequence "scene" "bakeseq" fps 30 { event 1000 0 }
</pre>

	</TR>
</TABLE>
</div>
<p>The first idle sequence is static at first frame so I used the reference SMD as the idle.  The bakeseq is my animation, I keyed it at 30fps because thats what i had in the editor (default).  Event 1000 at frame 0 is a "kill monster" event which marks the model as "dead" so it can no longer recieve any other inputs for whatever reason. <b>If your sim starts late you can use the QC command "frame X X" (x being start frame and 2nd end frame to crop your animation) before the fps line.</b> 
<p><b><a href="gold_mdl_comp.html">Compiling model info with crowbar here if needed.</a></b>
<p>For the "TireScene" this is my QC.  As you can see I have used the frame crop (my sim began a little later) and lowerfps and when I exported my scene I had a very long simulation so I used the fps retime as mentioned on the previous page.

<h2>Basic "BrickScene" setup</h2>

<p>(<a href="#tirescene">To skip to the "TireScene" setup click here.</a>)

<p>For a basic easy setup we go with Entity setup A:
<div align="left">
<table class="old">
	<TR>
		<TD>
		<pre>
Monster Generic
---------------
Name: Brickwall
Flags: "Not Solid"
Model: models/mymodels/brickphys.mdl

Scripted Sequence
---------------
Name: brick_anim
Flags: "Leave Corpse"
Target Monster: Brickwall
Action Animation: scene
Idle animation: idle

Func_wall_toggle (OPTIONAL)
---------------
Name: brick_anim
</pre>
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
</div>
<p><img src="goldphysimages/map_phys01.jpg">
<p>Use any way you want to trigger the "brick_anim" entity.  In my example I used a func_button to trigger it.  The optional func_wall_toggle is the same name as the scripted sequence so it toggles the same time as the animation sequence.  The func_wall toggle acts as a collision for the wall that makes it passible after.  If you don't need a toggle and just a simple collision object just make a simple "CLIP" brush around the model, otherwise have nothing.
<p id="sprites">If you need the model in a difficult place or a place that setup A does not work and gets the "yellow sprites: Stuck in wall" error, 
<p><img src="goldphysimages/map_phys02.jpg">
<p><b>...then go with setup B:</b>
<p>Entity setup B is the exact same setup only when creating the monster_generic it is put in an open space or floating in air, and the scripted sequence is in the place where the model should be.
<p>The best way to do this is first make your monster_generic and place it where you need it. Then shift-drag to copy the monster_generic entity.  Take the copy and move it in the air in an open area.  Then select the original monster_generic you made and turn the entity into the Scripted Sequence entity.  The only difference from setup A is add an additonal paramater for the scriped sequence which is "move to position" and set it to "instantaneous"

<h2 id="tirescene">"TireScene" setup</h2>
<p>For the tirescene setup we create this monster_generic & scripted sequence:
<div align="left">
<table class="old">
	<TR>
		<TD>
		<pre>
Monster Generic
---------------
Name: Tires
Flags: "Not Solid"
Model: models/mymodels/tirescene.mdl
Animation Sequence (editor): 1

Scripted Sequence
---------------
Name: tire_anim
Flags: "Leave Corpse"
Target Monster: Tires
Action Animation: scene
Idle animation: idle

env_explosion (OPTIONAL)
---------------
Name: tire_anim
</pre>
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
</div>
<p>Position your monster_generic to your model origin location you had in your 3d editor to match just like what you have here.  In my case I had 0 0 0 as the 3dsorigin which matches hammer origin <b>(If you used 3dsmax you may need to set the monster_generic's Yaw rotation to 270)</b>.  Using grid adjust I move the model into place and placing the yellow/red X which is the model origin at the world origin.
<p>Use any way you want to trigger the "tire_anim" entity.  In my example I used a func_button to trigger it.  In this demonstration im keeping the tires passable.
<p><b>If you need the model in a difficult place or a place that setup A does not work and gets the "yellow sprites: Stuck in wall" error, <a href="#sprites">do the fix as I did above with the "BrickScene".</a></b>
<p>With the "Animation Sequence (editor): 1" paramater set you can now watch the scene play in the viewport and make any last minute assesments to see if you need to do a rebake or recompile.
