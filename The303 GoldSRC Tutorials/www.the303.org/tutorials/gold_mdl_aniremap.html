<p>There are times when you want to take an animation from one NPC or playermodel and apply it to another model but there is either a heiarchy or proportion difference which stops you.  There is a way to do this which is called "Animation remapping", which is taking an animation from one skeleton and mapping it to another.  This can be done with ease in fragMOTION.

<p>A second related thing you may want to do is take a model skeleton and change its proportions without having to reanimate the whole animation set with it.  This can be done in 3dsmax and Blender using similar methods.

<p><b class="yellow">Before you begin, if you have two models that are identical in proportion but have the HL/Gearbox naming conflict you can actually just swap out SMDs and <a href="gold_qc.html">$include</a> this in your QC depending on which way you are going:</b>

For decompiling models needed for this use the latest version of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/CrowbarTool">Crowbar</a> in this configuration:
